@article{Kanik.2019,
 abstract = {Artificial muscles may accelerate the development of robotics, haptics, and prosthetics. Although advances in polymer-based actuators have delivered unprecedented strengths, producing these devices at scale with tunable dimensions remains a challenge. We applied a high-throughput iterative fiber-drawing technique to create strain-programmable artificial muscles with dimensions spanning three orders of magnitude. These fiber-based actuators are thermally and optically controllable, can lift more than 650 times their own weight, and withstand strains of {\textgreater}1000{\%}. Integration of conductive nanowire meshes within these fiber-based muscles offers piezoresistive strain feedback and demonstrates long-term resilience across {\textgreater}105 deformation cycles. The scalable dimensions of these fiber-based actuators and their strength and responsiveness may extend their impact from engineering fields to biomedical applications.},

@article{Leber.2023,
 abstract = {Stretchable and conductive nanocomposites are emerging as important constituents of soft mechanical sensors for health monitoring, human-machine interactions, and soft robotics. However, tuning the materials' properties and sensor structures to the targeted mode and range of mechanical stimulation is limited by current fabrication approaches, particularly in scalable polymer melt techniques. Here, thermoplastic elastomer-based nanocomposites are engineered and novel rheological requirements are proposed for their compatibility with fiber processing technologies, yielding meters-long, soft, and highly versatile stretchable fiber devices. Based on microstructural changes in the nanofiller arrangement, the resistivity of the nanocomposite is tailored in its final device architecture across an entire order of magnitude as well as its sensitivity to strain via tuning thermal drawing processing parameters alone. Moreover, the prescribed electrical properties are coupled with suitable device designs and several fiber-based sensors are proposed aimed at specific types of deformations: i) a robotic fiber with an integrated bending mechanism where changes as small as 5° are monitored by piezoresistive nanocomposite elements, ii) a pressure-sensing fiber based on a geometrically controlled resistive signal that responds with a sub-newton resolution to changes in pressing forces, and iii) a strain-sensing fiber that tracks changes in capacitance up to 100{\%} elongation.},

@article{Yu.2020,
 abstract = {New nanostructure means new nanotechnology and nanoscience. The need of complex nanostructure-based advanced functional nanomaterials has promoted the appearance of several kinds of multifluid electrospinning processes, such as tri-axial electrospinning, quad-fluid coaxial electrospinning, tri-fluid side-by-side electrospinning, and coaxial electrospinning with a side-by-side core. These multifluid processes can greatly expand the capability of electrospinning in generating new types of nanostructures with different organization manner of the inner parts, and from both spinnable and unspinnable working fluids. The key elements for conducting a multifluid electrospinning lie in a well-designed spinneret, compatibility of the working fluids, and special operational parameters. The complex nanostructures can be created through direct electrospinning of multiple fluids, through after-treatment of the electrospun products, and through ingenious design of the components, compositions and their spatial distributions as well. This article provides a simple review on the most recent publications about the multifluid electrospinning processes and the corresponding complex nanostructures. This article is characterized under: Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery {\textgreater} Emerging Technologies Implantable Materials and Surgical Technologies {\textgreater} Nanomaterials and Implants.},
